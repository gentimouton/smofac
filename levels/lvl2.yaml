# Duration between two fruits, in seconds, and fruit speed, in cells per second.
# Distance-wise, the number of cells between two fruits is: 
# spawn_period * fruit_speed.
# Careful: if fruit_speed < 1/spawn_period, 
# then the second fruit does not have space to appear, 
# and it causes a game over right away.
